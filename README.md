Description:

As part of a data science initiative aimed at reducing financial losses caused by last-minute cancellations in a cab booking company, I developed a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm. The company was facing significant monetary penalties due to cars being unavailable at the time of booking, leading to customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss.

Key Contributions:

Data Collection and Preparation: Gathered historical booking data, including customer details, booking times, car availability, and cancellation records. Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.

Feature Engineering: Engineered relevant features such as booking time, customer profile, geographic location, and previous cancellation patterns to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Model Development: Implemented a Random Forest algorithm to build a predictive model capable of estimating the likelihood of a booking being canceled at the time of reservation. Utilized techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Evaluation and Validation: Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Conducted rigorous validation tests to ensure the reliability and generalization of the model across different datasets.

Deployment and Integration: Collaborated with IT and operations teams to integrate the predictive model into the company's booking platform. Developed an automated system that generates real-time predictions for each booking request, allowing proactive measures to mitigate the risk of cancellations.

Results and Impact: The implemented predictive model successfully reduced the incidence of last-minute cancellations, leading to significant cost savings for the company and improving overall customer satisfaction. By accurately forecasting the likelihood of cancellations at the time of booking, the company could allocate resources more efficiently and minimize financial penalties.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Random Forest algorithm, Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
